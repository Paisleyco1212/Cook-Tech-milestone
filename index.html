   <h3> Direct Keyboards 1951 </h3> 
  <p> On <strong>July 4, 1956</strong> something amazing happened at MIT. No it was not a celebration of America's freedom, but something much more amazing. In that day and age, computers got their commands via dials and punch cards. Then one Doug Ross decided to change that on one of the earls high-speed computers, the Whirlwind. We think nothing of it today, but when he hooked up a keyboard to the Whirlwind, Doug made history. He got an electric typewriter, a Flexowriter, and he connected it to the Whirlwind. Soon they found that the keyboard not only worked, but it was highly useful and even more so covenant than what they had been using before hand. 
Just think. These men were just testing out something new, and now? Now everyone everywhere uses a keyboard! This was typed out with a keyboard as are everything nowadays. We can only think about what we would be doing today and how computers would function without this amazing milestone.

  <h3> A-0 1952 </h3>
   <p> Grace Hopper, an English mathematician and programmer. In <strong>1952 </strong>she did something absolutely amazing, something that had changed the world of computers forever. She completed the A-0,  which stands for Arithmetic Language version 0.  The A-0 System was a set of instructions that could translate symbolic mathematical code into machine language.

But even with something amazing like this, she was first met with disbelief and non acceptance. People could not believe that the computer could program itself, now computers back them could only do athermitic. It took two years of her trying to get others to even look at it, but then it became accepted.

 Grace Hopper’s work paved the way to more advanced programming languages. Ones like Python, or even HTML like how this website was Coded.

  <h3> The LaserDisc 1978 </h3>
      <p> Listing to your fave tunes in the car didn't used to be hooking up your phone to the car via an ox cord, and you couldn't watch you favorite movie on netflix. No instead we had CDs and DVDs, and even before then there were LaserDisc. The LaserDisc was one of the early home video formats, alongside VHS. LaserDisc had an edge over VHS though as it provides better quality video and audio. The LaserDisc was not very popular in North America, Europe, or Australia. But in Japan and other Southeast Asin regions,  they loved the LaserDisc. LaserDiscs were used as the foundation for CDs, DVDs, and blu-rays.

    <h3> The First Computer Program Ran on a Computer 1956 </h3>
    <p>People call things they love, Baby, a term of endearment for things we love. In <strong> 1948</strong> the Manchester “Baby”, or the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), was built to test new memory technology. The first program was seventeen instructions ran on  June 21st, 1948. This was a big deal as this was the first  computer program ever successfully ran. Freddie Williams,  a man who worked on the computer, is quoted  to say this on the day of the successful run, “This was in June 1948, and nothing was ever the same again."

    <h3> Apple 1984 commercial debuts </h3>
    <p> Everyone one loves Superbowl ads, with all their hype and all the hard work putinot them. On <strong>January 22, 1984</strong> it was no different, and one of those ads that played was Apple's “1984” commercial.  Ridley Scot directed the commercial, it costing almost three thousand dollars for just a minute long ad. The ad was of a single man  controlling the masses vai a large screen, then a woman destroyed the screen by smashing it with a hammer. The ad was of apple freeing the people from “big brother” who was a hidden referenced to apple's main competitor at the time, IBM. Even bing only shown once, the ad is considered to be giant turning point for computer marketing.
